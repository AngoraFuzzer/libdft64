Introduction
============
   Dynamic data flow tracking (DFT) deals with the tagging and tracking of
``interesting'' data as they propagate during program execution. DFT has been
repeatedly implemented by a variety of tools for numerous purposes, including
protection from buffer overflow and cross-site scripting attacks, analysis of
legitimate and malicious software, detection and prevention of information
leaks, etc. libdft is a dynamic DFT framework that unlike previous work, is at
once fast, reusable, and works with commodity software and hardware. libdft
provides an API, which can be used to deliver DFT-enabled tools that can be
applied on unmodified binaries running on common operating systems and hardware,
thus facilitating research and rapid prototyping.


Installation
============
   libdft relies on Pin (http://www.pintool.org), which is a dynamic binary
instrumentation (DBI) framework from Intel. In order to install libdft you first
need a working copy on the latest Pin build, as well as the essential build
tools for GNU/Linux (i.e., GCC, GNU Make, etc). After downloading and installing
Pin please follow the instructions noted in the INSTALL file, in order to finish
the installation of libdft.


Tools
=====
   libdft is designed to facilitate the creation of "Pintools" that employ
dynamic DFT. As the name implies, libdft is also a shared library, which can be 
used to transparently perform DFT on binaries. Additionally, it provides an API 
that enables tool authors to adjust the applied DFT by specifying data sources
and sinks, and customize the tag propagation policy. We have included three
simple Pin tools inside the `tools/' subdirectory to aid the development of
DFT-powered Pintools. The first is `nullpin', which is essentially a null tool
that runs a process using Pin without any form of instrumentation or analysis.
This tool can be used to measure the overhead imposed by Pin’s runtime
environment. The second uses libdft to apply DFT on the application being
executed, but does not use any of the API functions to define data sources and
sinks (i.e., it does not customize the applied DFT). The name of this tool is
`libdft', and similarly to the previous case it can be used to evaluate the
overhead imposed by libdft. Finally, the third tool, namely `libdft-dta', is
used in order to illustrate the API of libdft, and serves as template for future
meta-tools. In particular, it implements a dynamic taint analysis (DTA)
platform by transparently utilizing DFT in unmodified x86 Linux binaries.
   DTA operates by tagging all data coming from the network as "tainted",
tracking their propagation, and alerting the user when they are used in a way
that could compromise his system. In this case, the network is the source of
"interesting" data, while instructions that are used to control a program’s flow
are the sinks. For the x86 architecture, these are jumps and function calls with
non-immediate operands, as well as function returns. Oftentimes, attackers are
able to manipulate the operands of such instructions by abusing various types of
software memory errors such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, 
dangling pointers, etc. They can then seize control of a program by redirecting 
execution to existing code (e.g., return-to-libc, ROP), or their own injected
instructions. libdft-dta checks if tainted data are used in indirect control
transfers, and if so, it halts execution with an informative message containing 
the offending instruction and the contents of the instruction pointer EIP.


Usage
=====
   After building both libdft and the accompanying tools (i.e., nullpin, libdft,
and libdft-dta), you can apply them directly in unmodified x86 Linux binaries
as follows (assuming that Pin in installed in `/usr/src/pin', and libdft in your
local home directory):
     
	/usr/src/pin/pin -follow_execv -t ~/libdft/tools/nullpin -- <executable>

  a. `-follow_execv' command line switch is used in order to execute all
     processes spawned by the exec(3) class system calls with Pin

  b. `-t' command line switch specifies the corresponding tool

  nullpin and libdft are dummy tools and hence they take no arguments. However, 
in libdft-dta you can specify the file that logs alerts and policy violations by
using the `-o' command line switch after the tool name and before `--'.
